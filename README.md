# Plugin: Character Locomotion System

## Overview
The **Character Locomotion System** is an experimental Unreal Engine plugin designed to enhance character movement capabilities.  
It is specifically tailored for versions **5.3** and **5.4**.  
This plugin introduces advanced movement modes such as **prone**, **slide**, **vault**, **climb**, **climb up**, **mantle**, **wall run**, and **dash**, allowing developers to create immersive and dynamic gameplay experiences.

**Note:** As this plugin is experimental, it may cause issues or unexpected behavior during development.  
Users should thoroughly test all features in their projects.

## Supported Versions
- **Unreal Engine 5.3**
- **Unreal Engine 5.4**

## Test Project Showcase
To facilitate testing and experimentation with the Character Locomotion System, a dedicated test project is provided.  
This project showcases the features and functionalities of the plugin for both Unreal Engine versions.

## Movement Modes
The Character Locomotion System supports the following advanced movement modes:

- **Prone:**  
  Allows characters to lie flat on the ground, enhancing stealth mechanics and cover utilization.

- **Slide:**  
  Enables characters to perform a sliding action, useful for evasive maneuvers and fast-paced gameplay.

- **Vault:**  
  Provides the ability to smoothly transition over obstacles, enhancing fluidity in movement.

- **Climb:**  
  Allows characters to ascend vertical surfaces, adding verticality to gameplay.

- **Climb Up:**  
  A specialized movement for reaching higher platforms or ledges.

- **Mantle:**  
  Facilitates the transition from a lower position to a higher surface, seamlessly blending climbing and vaulting.

- **Wall Run:**  
  Enables characters to run along vertical surfaces, adding a dynamic element to navigation.

- **Dash:**  
  A quick burst of speed in a designated direction, ideal for dodging or closing gaps in combat.

## Easy Integration and Extension

### Seamless Integration
The Character Locomotion System is designed for straightforward integration into existing Unreal Engine projects.  
With minimal setup requirements, developers can quickly incorporate advanced movement mechanics without extensive modifications to their current architecture.  
The plugin adheres to Unreal Engineâ€™s best practices, ensuring compatibility with standard character movement systems.

### Flexible Extension
The plugin provides a robust framework that allows for easy extension of movement capabilities. Developers can:

- **Add Custom Movement Modes:**  
  Easily implement additional movement modes tailored to specific gameplay needs, leveraging the existing architecture.

- **Modify Existing Features:**  
  Adjust parameters and behaviors of current movement modes to suit the unique requirements of their game.

### Multiplayer Support
The Character Locomotion System is engineered with multiplayer functionality in mind:

- **Replication-Friendly:**  
  Movement modes are designed to be fully replicated, ensuring that all clients experience synchronized movement behavior. This is critical for competitive and cooperative gameplay.

- **Customizable Synchronization:**  
  Developers can extend or modify replication logic to tailor movement behavior for specific gameplay scenarios, allowing for both server-authoritative and client-predicted movement.

- **Blueprint Integration:**  
  The use of BlueprintNativeEvents allows for easy customization and behavior overrides, making it simpler for designers to tweak movement functionality without deep programming knowledge.

## Summary
With its experimental nature, seamless integration, flexible extension capabilities, and robust multiplayer support, the Character Locomotion System provides a comprehensive solution for enhancing character movement in Unreal Engine projects. 

This plugin streamlines the implementation process and empowers developers to create dynamic and engaging gameplay experiences.  
However, keep in mind that it is still in an experimental phase, and users may encounter issues or unexpected behaviors during development.
